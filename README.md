## About

Scrub the timeline to watch four distinct city zones transform:

### 🏠 Residential
- Garages become ground-floor cafes and shops
- Roads transform into greenways with pedestrian paths
- Rooftop gardens appear, trees multiply
- Kids play, cyclists ride, street musicians perform
- Delivery robots and helper robots serve the community

### 🏭 Industrial  
- Human-scale factories become robot-optimized vertical towers
- No windows needed - robots don't need light
- 3D conveyor systems move in all directions
- Warehouses become dense automated storage grids
- Assembly lines become 3D printer farms
- Former parking lots rewild with meadows and deer

### 🚉 Transit Hub
- Bus terminals evolve into autonomous pod stations
- Parking garages become transit plazas with bike share
- Diesel trains upgrade to maglev
- Smooth construction/demolition transitions

### 🏙️ Downtown
- Car-dominated streets become pedestrian plazas
- Farmers markets and food courts appear
- Central fountains, communal dining tables
- Vertical gardens climb buildings
- Community gathers in shared spaces
